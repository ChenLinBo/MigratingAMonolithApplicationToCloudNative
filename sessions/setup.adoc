= Course Setup

Ideally this setup should be completed before you attend the course.

== Note

Much of this course involves using command line tools rather than
GUI applications.  This may be unfamiliar to some of you.

In particular, Windows users will need to open and use Command windows. To do this
press WK + R and type `cmd` (where WK is the Windows Key).  image::./Common/images/winkey.png[]

== Java

A Java 8 JDK needs to be installed.  Go to Oracle at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
and click the Java download button on the right.  You should be on the page to
download the "Java SE Development Kit".

Click the radio-button to say you "Accept License Agreement" and then pick the
right JDK for your platform.  Make sure you are downloading the JDK _not_ the JRE.

Once downloaded, run the installer.  It takes a while to run.

== IDE

We recommend installing the integrated development environment of your choice,
such as Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite (STS) or IntelliJ.  If you have no preference
we recommend STS as it has additional support for the Spring facilities used during
the course.

 * STS: http://spring.io/tools  The download is a zip file, so unpack it somewhere
convenient.  Windows users are recommended to unpack it directly into `C:\` otherwise
you will have problems exceeding the maximum path length (yes even on Windows 8 and 10).
+
Once unpacked you should find a directory similar to `sts_bundle/sts-3.7.1.RELEASE-e4.5.1`
(the versions will differ).  In here is the executable for STS (`STS.exe`, `STS.app` or
`STS`).

 * Eclipse: https://eclipse.org/downloads/  Either use the Installer or choose
"Eclipse IDE for Java Developers ".
 
 * IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/  The Community Edition is free
and will be sufficient for this course.

An IDE is not required to do this course, but if you prefer not to use an IDE, you
will need to use your favorite editor instead.  Windows users are recommended to
download the free Notepad++s editor from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloaa.d

== Maven

Download Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi - select the binary zip archive
(Windows) or the binary tar.gz archive (MacOS, Linux).

Once downloaded, you need to add the bin directory to your execution path.

* Windows - Right click My Computer/This PC -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment variables ...
PATH should already exist, click Edit and add to the end.  Don't forget to add a semicolon first.
For more details on how to do this see http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm.

* MacOS, Linux - Assuming you are using a BASH shell, edit `~/.bashrc` and add:
+
```
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/maven/bin
```

You will need to close any existing Terminal/Cmd windows and open a new one for the change to take effect.

== Git Command-Line Utility

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads, click the image corresponding to your platform, download the installer and run it.

*Warning:* Ignore the large computer monitor labelled "Latest source Release".

* Windows users: When running the installer, select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" (this is not the default).
Accept all other defaults.

== Cloud Foundry Command-Line Utility

Go to https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases, download and run the right installer for your platform.

== Testing Your Setup

If everything has installed correctly, _open a brand new_ Terminal/Cmd window.  You should be able to run
the following:

```
java -version
mvn -version
git --version
cf --version
```
