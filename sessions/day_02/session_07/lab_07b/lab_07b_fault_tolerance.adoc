= Lab 07c - Fault-Tolerance with Hystrix

[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
We'll again use Spring Cloud Netflix to implement client-side load balancing with Ribbon.
However, this time we'll add an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern using Netflix Hystrix.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Refactor the consumer application from link:../../session_07/lab_07a/lab_07a_load_balancing.adoc[Lab 07a] to add a slightly different `ProducerClient` than we added in link:../../session_07/lab_07b/lab_07b_feign.adoc[Lab 07b].
. Test the new consumer version against our local pool of producers
. Kill one of the producers and watch the consumer failover.
. Kill the remaining producer and watch the circuit breaker fallback behavior.
. Restart a producer and watch the consumer recover.

== Setup

. A completed `springtrader-config-server` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-config-server` for your convenience.
In a terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-config-server
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-config-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springtrader-eureka` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-eureka` for your convenience.
In a separate terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-eureka
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-eureka-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springtrader-producer` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-producer` for your convenience.
In two separate terminal windows, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application (on different ports):
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-producer
$ mvn package
$ SERVER_PORT=8080 java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
$ SERVER_PORT=8082 java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

if you are working on WINDOWS prompt, then run following
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-producer
$ mvn package
$ set SERVER_PORT=8080 && java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
$ set SERVER_PORT=8082 && java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----


. Ensure you have two instances of the producer service registered in Eureka:

== Using Hystrix

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07c/initial/springtrader-consumer
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-hystrix</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. Add a `@EnableCircuitBreaker` annotation to the class `io.springtrader.consumer.SpringtraderConsumerApplication`.

. Add two constructors to the class `io.springtrader.consumer.ProducerResponse`:
+
[source,java]
----
public ProducerResponse() {
}

public ProducerResponse(int value) {
    this.value = value;
}
----

. Create the class `io.springtrader.consumer.ProducerClient` and into it paste the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class ProducerClient {

    @Autowired
    @LoadBalanced
    RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "getProducerFallback")
    public ProducerResponse getValue() {
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://producer", ProducerResponse.class);
    }

    private ProducerResponse getProducerFallback() {
        return new ProducerResponse(42);
    }
}
----

. Refactor the class `io.springtrader.consumer.ConsumerController` to autowire the `ProducerClient` instead of `RestTemplate`, and then use it to obtain the `ProducerResponse`:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ProducerClient client;

@RequestMapping(value = "/", produces = "application/json")
String consume() {
    ProducerResponse response = client.getValue();
    return String.format("{\"value\":%d}", response.getValue());
}
----

. To the file `src/main/resources/application.properties` add the following:
+
----
producer.ribbon.ServerListRefreshInterval=5000
----

. Build the application:
+
----
$ mvn clean package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/lab_07c-springtrader-consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Test the consumer application and show that it is still receiving values from the producers.
Also, watch the producers and observe that Ribbon is performing round robin load balancing across the two producers:
+
----
http://localhost:8081

Goto and check both producer windows. You should be getting a value counter starting from 0. Refresh your page and then see the counter increases.
----

== Failover

. Shut down one of the two producer processes.

. reload url, test the consumer application and show that it is still receiving values from one of the producers.
+
You may get the fallback value of `42` a few times due to the lag in removing the failed instance from the Ribbon cache. Eventually it will converge to hitting the only remaining healthy instance.

== Fallback

. Shut down the remaining producer process.

. Reload url, test the consumer application and show that it is only emitting the fallback value of `42`.

== Recovery

. Restart one of the producer processes. Wait for it to register with Eureka.

. Reload url, test the consumer application and show that eventually recovers and starts hitting the new producer process. This can take several seconds as the Eureka and Ribbon caches repopulate.

== Next Steps

Do not shut anything down when you complete this lab. We will add one additional component in link:../../session_07/lab_07d/lab_07d_hystrix_dashboard.adoc[Lab 07d].
