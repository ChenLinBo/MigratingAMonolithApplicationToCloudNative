= Course Setup

Ideally this setup should be completed before you attend the course.

== IDE

We recommend installing the integrated development environment of your choice,
such as Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite (STS) or IntelliJ.  If you have no preference
we recommend STS as it has additional support for the Spring facilities used during
the course.

 1. STS: http://spring.io/tools  The download is a zip file, so unpack it somewhere
convenient.  Windows users are recommended to unpack it directly into C:\ otherwise
you will have problems exceeding the maximum path length (yes even on Windows 10)
+
Once unpacked you should find directory similar to `sts_bundle/sts-3.7.1.RELEASE-e4.5.1`
(the versions will differ).  In here is the executable for STS (STS.exe, STS.app or
STS).

An IDE is not required to do this course, but if you prefer not to use an IDE, you
will need to use your favorite editor instead.

== Maven
